# First Assignment in Github 

## Knowledge gained while creating md file:
    
      I gained knowledge in searching and where to start the process then I get to know that I need to create 
      a repository to add a markdown file. I am just confused weather i had done correctly or not.
      I had doubt still regarding my repository in the code<> page on the left side it two names of repositories.
      
     
## Little bit Introduction of self :-)

      I am Nikesh Chimula and interested in learning new things and had a passion to learn towards the technologies.
      I had a dream to create a well-known, helpful application and it would reduce time and space to 
      handle a particular situation.
      I am going on in gaining knowledge in coding,database and easy ways to handle different situations.
      My favourite hobby is playing games,carom,shuttle and chess.
      
## Regarding what I liked and dislikes while doing this: 

      I liked searching to create a repository and then adding a markdown file. While even using different 
      styles as it is much similar to HTML.
      I don't have any dislikes because while we learning a new thing or subject we definitely face a lot of
      challenges.
