# First Assignment in Github 

## Knowledge gained while creating md file:
    
      I gained a knowledge in searching and where to start the process then I get to know that I need to create 
      a repository file to add markdown file. I had doubt still regarding my repository in the code<> page on the left side it showing
      two names of repositories.
      
## Little bit Introduction of self :-)

      I am Nikesh Chimula and interested in learning new things and had a passion towards the technologies.
      I had a dream to create a well-knowed, helpfull application and it would be reduce time and space to 
      handle particular situation.
      I am going on in gaining the knowledge in coding,database and easy way to handle in different situations.
      My favourite hobby is playing games,carom,shettle and chess.
      
## Regarding what I liked and dislikes while doing this: 

      I liked searching to create a repository and then adding a markdown file. While even using different 
      styles as it is much similar to HTML.
      I don't have any dislikes because while we learning a new thing or subject we definitely face a lot of
      challenges.
